Teaching is one of the core responsibilities of an academic. It is an intellectually enriching activity as it helps in re-enforcing one’s own understanding of topics. The role of a teacher is to enable students to develop knowledge and skills useful in their ensuing careers. My teaching goal is to ensure that students not only get significant takeaways from my teaching, but also become better learners. As a graduate student, I have lived my dream each day for the past four years; doing research, writing scholarly papers and teaching multiple cohorts of competitive students. The MIS department, University of Arizona recognized my teaching efforts and awarded me the La Salle teaching excellence award in December 2017, encouraging me to continue my student-centric approach to teaching.

I was provided the opportunity to teach the following two different undergraduate courses during the year 2016-17: (a) MIS 111 – Computers and Internetworked Society in Summer 2016, and (b) MIS 331 – Database Management Systems in Fall 2017. In addition, I have worked as a teaching assistant during Spring 2016, Fall 2016 and Spring 2017 semesters for MIS 587 – Business Intelligence; an 8-week mini-semester course offered by Professor Sudha Ram in the MISonline Masters’ program.
