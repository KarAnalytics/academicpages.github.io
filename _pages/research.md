As a PhD student, I have been working in two independent projects, namely Wellbuilt-for-Wellbeing and Knowledge discovery through disease networks. The first project is a
multi-disciplinary project with an overarching goal of identifying environmental factors
affecting individual wellbeing in the workplace. In the second project, I study the impact
of the simultaneous occurrence of two or more diseases on patient health outcomes.
Through the two projects, I got the opportunity of analyzing health and wellbeing from
a clinical perspective as well as a non-clinical perspective; a unique experience that was
instrumental in shaping my research trajectory.

My current research outputs can be placed into three categories: (a) Preventive care with focus on disease occurrence and co-occurrence in patient visits, (b) Digital health application of environment-wellbeing modeling at workplace, (c) Data analytics methods
