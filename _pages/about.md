My name is Karthik Srinivasan and I am a fourth year Ph.D Student in the Management Information Systems (MIS) department, Eller College of Management at University of Arizona. My Ph.D advisor is Professor Sudha Ram.

## My research interests

I am interested in healthcare data analysis and digital health. My current research is focused on addressing two independent problems - human stress/well-being modeling and studying the impact of disease co-occurrence on patient health outcomes. I am currently working in two projects, namely _Wellbuilt-to-Wellbeing_ and _Knowledge discovery through disease networks_. The first project is a multi-disciplinary project with an overarching goal of identifying environmental factors that affect individual wellbeing in workplace, and the second project is about studying the impact of simultaneous presence of two or more diseases on hospital patient outcomes such as disease progression, mortality, visit costs and re-admissions.

Working in [INSITE: Center for Business Intelligence and Analytics](https://www.insiteua.org/ "INSITE: Center for Business Intelligence and Analytics") as a research associate for the past four years, I got the opportunity to work in multiple projects. My research contributions are focused towards explaining an existing phenomenon and knowledge discovery (i.e. explanatory modeling) as well as engineering features from given data and training data mining models for predictive purposes (i.e. predictive modeling). My research involves application of statistical models, machine learning and network science to explain a phenomenon or provide accurate predictions an outcome. My research contributions can be categorized into two broad categories - Novel applications of data analysis methods, and improvement to existing data analysis methods. In the first category, the primary focus is on modeling an underlying phenomenon with the aim of knowledge discovery. The second category of research involves identifying methodological gaps in data analysis processes such as data processing, feature extraction, model development, prediction and proposing improvment in the methods.

## My background

I am a PhD research scholar, living my dream each day of my life as a researcher; aspiring to become a professor in the future.  I work as a research associate in the INSITE Center for Business Intelligence and Analytics focusing on big data analysis in the healthcare domain. Previously, I have worked in a couple of companies as a software developer and data scientist.
