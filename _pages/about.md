My name is Karthik Srinivasan and I am an Assistant Professor in the Business Analytics area of [School of Business at University of Kansas](https://business.ku.edu/) (SoB KU). I completed my PhD in Management Information Systems in 2019 at University of Arizona. My Ph.D advisor is Professor [Sudha Ram](https://mis.eller.arizona.edu/people/sudha-ram).

My primary research focuses on addressing novel and important challenges in healthcare analytics, particularly in the areas of digital health and preventive care. I use a combination of network science, machine learning, and statistical modeling approaches to develop solutions for my research problems.

I was the instructor for BSAN/IST 325 - Systems Analysis and Design and BSAN/IST 326 - Database Management Systems in Fall 2019 at SoB KU.

My current research projects are in healthcare analytics, machine learning interpretability, and NLP in accounting analytics.
