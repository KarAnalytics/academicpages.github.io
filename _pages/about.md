My name is Karthik Srinivasan and I am doing my Ph.D in Management Information Systems (MIS) at the [University of Arizona](https://mis.eller.arizona.edu/). My Ph.D advisor is Professor [Sudha Ram](https://mis.eller.arizona.edu/people/sudha-ram).

My primary research focus areas are preventive care analytics and digital health analytics. I am also interested in the study and development of information systems to improve the efficiency and affordability of healthcare.    

Preventive care and digital health are two application domains of healthcare information systems (HIS) analytics. Preventive care analytics is the science of extracting population-level insights from electronic health records to assist preventive care policies, while digital health analytics focuses on enhancing individual wellbeing via continuous tracking of health indicators. With rapid development in healthcare big data and sensor technologies, research in these two areas is increasing in importance and complexity. Innovative methods are required for processing and analyzing the complex data generated from such systems. My current research focuses on addressing the challenges in preventive care and digital health analytics using novel statistical machine learning methods. I use a combination of statistics, network science, quantitative modeling and machine learning approaches to develop analytical methods for addressing specific research questions.

As a PhD student, I have been working in two independent projects, namely Wellbuilt-for-Wellbeing and Knowledge discovery through disease networks. The first project is a multi-disciplinary project with an overarching goal of identifying environmental factors affecting individual wellbeing in the workplace. In the second project, I study the impact of the simultaneous occurrence of two or more diseases on patient health outcomes. Through the two projects, I had the opportunity of analyzing health and wellbeing from a clinical perspective as well as a non-clinical perspective; a unique experience that was instrumental in shaping my research trajectory.
My dissertation consists of five essays, presenting a collection of statistical machine learning methods. In the essays, I discuss the development and application of methods to answer the following questions:
*	How can we effectively identify high cost patients at point of admission in hospitals?
*	How can we effectively predict multiple disease risks at point of admission in hospitals?
*	What is the relationship between workplace stress, physical activity and workstation type?
*	How is sound level at the workplace related to physiological wellbeing?
*	How can we analyze data and make predictions with incomplete data containing block-wise missing patterns?

The first and second essays demonstrate applications in preventive care analytics using network science and predictive modeling methods. The third and fourth essays leverage explanatory modeling approaches to a digital health application, determining the impact of different factors in building design on wellbeing of office workers. The fifth essay presents a method to analyze incomplete data in health analytics and digital health applications. Essay 1 is complete and published in the Journal of Biomedical Health Informatics, 2017 (early access). Essay 3 is accepted and forthcoming at Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, July 2018.
