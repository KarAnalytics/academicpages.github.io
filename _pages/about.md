My name is Karthik Srinivasan and I am doing my Ph.D in Management Information Systems at the [University of Arizona](https://mis.eller.arizona.edu/). My Ph.D advisor is Professor [Sudha Ram](https://mis.eller.arizona.edu/people/sudha-ram).

Preventive care and digital health are two application domains of healthcare information systems analytics. Preventive care analytics is the science of extracting population-level insights from electronic health records to assist preventive care policies, while digital health analytics focuses on enhancing individual wellbeing via continuous tracking of health indicators. With rapid development in healthcare big data and sensor technologies, research in these two areas is increasing in importance and complexity. Innovative methods are required for processing and analyzing the complex data generated from such systems.

My research focuses on addressing novel and important challenges in digital health and preventive care using a combination of network science, machine learning, and statistical modeling approaches.
