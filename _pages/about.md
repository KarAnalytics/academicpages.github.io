My name is Karthik Srinivasan and I am an Assistant Professor in the Business Analytics area in [School of Business at University of Kansas](https://business.ku.edu/) (SoB KU). I completed my PhD in Management Information Systems in 2019 at University of Arizona. My Ph.D advisor is Professor [Sudha Ram](https://mis.eller.arizona.edu/people/sudha-ram).

My research focuses on addressing novel and important challenges in healthcare information systems, particularly in digital health and preventive care. My methodological contributions involve the use of network science, machine learning, and statistical modeling approaches.
