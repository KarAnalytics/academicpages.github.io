I enjoy teaching. As a graduate student, I have lived my dream each day for the past four years; doing research, writing scholarly papers and teaching multiple cohorts of competitive students. The MIS department, University of Arizona recognized my teaching efforts and awarded me the La Salle teaching excellence award in 2017, encouraging me to continue my student-centric approach to teaching. My teaching philosophy is to prioritize course content, actively engage students, make students think for themselves, allow students to collaborate and take periodic student feedback.

I was provided the opportunity to teach the following two different undergraduate courses during the year 2016-17: (a) MIS 111 – Computers and Internetworked Society in Summer 2016, and (b) MIS 331 – Database Management Systems in Fall 2017. In addition, I have worked as a teaching assistant during Spring 2016, Fall 2016 and Spring 2017 semesters for MIS 587 – Business Intelligence; an 8-week mini-semester course offered by Professor Sudha Ram in the MISonline Masters’ program.
